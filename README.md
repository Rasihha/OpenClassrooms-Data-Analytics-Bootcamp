## Python Project

* This data acquisition project for the Parks and Open Spaces team of a County Council involved 
assessing the quality of a dataset for a Public Service Agency to help them decide if they have good enough data to deliver on several
projects.
* Python functions were used to compile and clean the data to then evaluate its quality.
